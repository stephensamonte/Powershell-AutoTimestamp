# Windows AutoTimestamp 

I ceate a lot of files for classes, video projects, and personal ventures. I always date documents and project files in their name such as "2018.09.03 MyNotes" (year.month.day filename). 
  
## Why Do I do this? 
This prevents me from losing the date created information when the file is copied. When a file is copied the newly created file will show the current date in which the file was created rather than the date the original file was created. 

NOTE: THIS DOES NOT WORK CURRENTLY THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
